# job-description
A Shiny app for searching a database of descriptions of previous work performed.

This is a look-up app for searching details of previous work performed by a free-lancer/company etc. The CSV file for this project contains a list of previous work performed, including the name of the client, the sector the client is involved in, the name of the project, a detailed descriptioon of work performed, and the cost billed to the client. 

Simply open this app in R, set your working directory to the appropriate folder where the App.r, dummyData.csv and www folder are saved. Run the code and you are done. 
The CSV can of course be altered to suit your needs.
